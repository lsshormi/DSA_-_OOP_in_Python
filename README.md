## Data Structures
Data Structure is a way to store and organize data efficiently.
DS has two categories, Linear and non-linear

### Linear
- Array
- LinkedList
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hashing
  
### Non-Linear
- Tree
- Graph

Explore various data structures implemented in Python, such as lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

## Algorithms
An algorithm is a set of commands that must be followed for a computer to perform calculations or other problem-solving operations.
Discover Python implementations of popular algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and other problem-solving techniques.

## Object-Oriented Programming
Learn and practice Object-Oriented Programming principles in Python with real-world examples and exercises.
